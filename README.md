**Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM**

This project aims to predict the future stock prices of a selected company using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The prediction model is built using Python and implemented in a Jupyter notebook.

**Overview**

Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial research. By leveraging LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies, this project attempts to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The model can help investors and analysts make informed decisions.

**Features**

* Data Collection: Fetch historical stock price data for the selected company.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
* LSTM Model: Build and train an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
* Visualization: Plot the actual vs. predicted stock prices to evaluate model performance.

**Technologies Used**

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* TensorFlow, Keras
